# Kalman-Enhanced Ultrasonic Radar: Arduino Obstacle Detection System  

## Objectives:
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a **low-cost ultrasonic radar system** capable of detecting obstacles in its environment while mitigating measurement noise through **Kalman filtering**. The system aims to:  

- Demonstrate the integration of an ultrasonic sensor with a servo motor for angular scanning.  
- Apply a state estimation algorithm (1D Kalman filter) to enhance the accuracy and reliability of distance measurements.  
- Provide a hands-on platform for students to understand predictive filtering, sensor fusion, and real-time data visualization.  
- Illustrate potential applications of radar-like sensing in robotics, automotive safety, and environmental monitoring.

## Project Overview:
This project models a **miniature radar system** using the Arduino Uno, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, and a micro servo motor. The ultrasonic sensor is mounted on the servo, which sweeps across a defined angular range (20Â°â€“160Â°), emulating a radar scanning motion. At each angular step, distance measurements are acquired, filtered, and plotted in real time.  

A **Kalman filter** is embedded in the microcontroller code to smooth sensor readings by combining predictions with noisy measurements. This filtering process produces more consistent range data compared to raw sensor outputs, thereby enabling more robust obstacle detection.  

The system is implemented within **Tinkercad Circuits**, enabling students to engage in experimentation, prototyping, and replication in a virtual setting, while retaining the flexibility to extend the design to physical hardware.

## Working Principle:  
The system functions by integrating servo-based scanning, ultrasonic measurement, predictive filtering, and visual feedback into a unified obstacle detection platform:  

1. **Servo-based Scanning:** The servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor in discrete angular increments between 20Â° and 160Â°, emulating the sweep of a radar antenna.  
2. **Distance Measurement:** At each position, the Arduino activates the HC-SR04 sensor to emit an ultrasonic pulse and measure the time delay of the returning echo, which is then converted into a distance value.  
3. **Kalman Filtering:** Raw measurements are processed through a one-dimensional Kalman filter, which fuses the predicted state with the new measurement. This reduces noise, smooths fluctuations, and produces a more reliable distance profile.  
4. **Data Visualization:** The processed and raw data are transmitted in CSV format to the Arduino Serial Plotter, enabling a visual comparison between noisy and filtered outputs.  
5. **Alert Mechanism:** An LED indicator illuminates whenever an object is detected within a predefined threshold (e.g., < 25 cm), providing a demonstration of a simple obstacle-warning system.
